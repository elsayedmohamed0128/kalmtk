## Verification Process

### 1. Dependency Validation
- **React Navigation v6**: ✅ Verified against https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/
- **Zustand**: ✅ Verified against https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction
- **AsyncStorage**: ✅ Verified against https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/
- **React Native Hooks & Context API**: ✅ Verified against https://react.dev/

### 2. Code Implementation Validation
- **Navigation System**: ✅ All navigator components validated
- **State Management**: ✅ All store components validated
- **Theme System**: ✅ Context provider validated
- **Screen Components**: ✅ Sample screens validated

## Detailed Verification Results

### React Navigation v6 Implementation
- **AppNavigator.js**: Correctly implements root navigation with authentication-based routing
- **AuthNavigator.js**: Properly configured stack navigator for authentication flow
- **MainTabNavigator.js**: Correctly implements tab-based navigation with conditional admin tab
- **Child Navigators**: All stack navigators correctly implemented with proper screen options

### Zustand Store Implementation
- **useUserStore.js**: Properly implements user authentication state with persistence
- **usePromptStore.js**: Correctly manages prompt history with persistence
- **Middleware Usage**: Persist middleware correctly configured with partialize option

### AsyncStorage Implementation
- **ThemeContext.js**: Correctly uses getItem/setItem for theme preference persistence
- **Error Handling**: Proper try/catch blocks implemented for async operations

### React Hooks & Context API
- **ThemeContext.js**: Correctly implements provider pattern with system theme detection
- **Hook Usage**: useState, useEffect, useContext properly implemented
- **Performance**: useColorScheme hook correctly utilized for system theme detection
