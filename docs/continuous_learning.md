# Kalimtak Continuous Learning System

## Overview

Kalimtak implements a comprehensive continuous learning system that enables the AI model to improve over time through user interactions and feedback. This system captures user interactions, curates high-quality training data, and fine-tunes the model periodically to enhance performance.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Captures user interactions through API endpoints
   - Stores raw interaction data in Supabase
   - Collects user feedback on generated prompts

2. **Data Processing Pipeline (ETL)**
   - Extracts high-quality interactions based on feedback scores
   - Transforms interactions into training format
   - Loads curated data into training datasets

3. **Model Training Orchestrator**
   - Manages the complete training cycle
   - Coordinates fine-tuning processes
   - Handles model versioning and deployment

4. **Task Scheduler**
   - Runs periodic tasks for data curation
   - Triggers model fine-tuning cycles
   - Executes model evaluation procedures

5. **Model Registry**
   - Tracks model versions and performance metrics
   - Manages model deployment status
   - Facilitates rollback capabilities

## Data Models

### User Interaction
```python
class UserInteraction(BaseModel):
    id: str
    user_id: Optional[str] = None
    session_id: Optional[str] = None
    input_text: str
    structured_prompt: str
    model_output: str
    tokens_input: Optional[int] = None
    tokens_output: Optional[int] = None
    tokens_total: Optional[int] = None

    target_tool: Optional[str] = None
    language: Optional[str] = None
    feedback_score: Optional[int] = None
    feedback_text: Optional[str] = None
    ip_address: Optional[str] = None
    user_agent: Optional[str] = None
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

### Training Data Item
```python
class TrainingDataItem(BaseModel):
    id: str
    source_interaction_id: str
    input_prompt: str
    target_output: str
    quality_score: Optional[float] = None
    domain_category: Optional[str] = None
    use_case: Optional[str] = None
    is_curated: bool = False
    is_selected: bool = False
    created_at: datetime
```

## Data Flow

1. **Interaction Logging**
   - User submits a prompt through the API
   - System generates a structured prompt and response
   - Interaction is logged with metadata and performance metrics
   - Data stored in `user_interactions` table

2. **Feedback Collection**
   - Users provide feedback on generated prompts (1-5 scale)
   - Feedback updates the interaction record
   - High-quality interactions (score >= 4) become training candidates

3. **Data Curation**
   - Daily task extracts high-quality interactions
   - ETL pipeline transforms interactions into training format
   - Data quality assurance filters and deduplicates samples
   - Curated data stored in `training_data` table

4. **Model Training**
   - Weekly task initiates full training cycle
   - Training dataset prepared from curated data
   - Model fine-tuning executed with new dataset
   - Performance metrics evaluated and recorded

5. **Model Deployment**
   - New model versions registered in model registry
   - Deployment status tracked and managed
   - Gradual rollout to production environment

## API Endpoints

### Generate Prompt
```
POST /api/generate
```
Generates a structured prompt from user input and logs the interaction for learning.

### Submit Feedback
```
POST /api/feedback
```
Submits user feedback for a specific interaction to improve future training.

### Curate Training Data
```
POST /api/admin/curate-training-data
```
Admin endpoint to manually trigger training data curation process.

## Scheduled Tasks

## Privacy and Compliance

### Data Protection
- All user data is stored securely in Supabase
- Personal identifiers are separated from interaction data
- Data retention policies ensure compliance with regulations

### GDPR/CCPA Compliance
- Users can request deletion of their data
- Opt-out mechanisms for data collection
- Transparent data usage policies

### Data Anonymization
- User IDs are separated from interaction content
- IP addresses are stored separately from interaction data
- Aggregated metrics used for model improvement
